A Journey by the Sea

The waves crash gently on the shore,
A rhythmic dance, forevermore.
The salty breeze, the seagulls' cry,
Beneath the vast, cerulean sky.

Footprints fade in golden sand,
A fleeting mark, a gentle hand.
The sun dips low, a crimson hue,
The day's adieu, a twilight view.

Stars emerge, a cosmic light,
Guiding sailors through the night.
A journey's end, yet still it seems,
Life flows like the sea, in dreams.
